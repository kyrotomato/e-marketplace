## Installation
Download the folder, in the develop folder install mysql2, express, sequelize, dotenv (you will also need to create a .env file with your mysql credentials), and node.
## Usage
Simply open the urls for the related API endpoints in insomnia. Each product, category, and tag has its own get, put, post, and delete functions. Get will display the database information related to the api endpoint. Post will create the related object. Put will edit an existing object, and delete will remove it.
